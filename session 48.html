<h3 style="color: grey;"><b>A piece of street art possibly created by secretive graffiti artist Banksy has been removed over flooding fears.</b></h3>
<h3 style="color: black;">The artwork in Nicholas Everitt Park near Lowestoft, Suffolk, depicted three children, who appeared to be stood in a small boat placed under the painting.<br>
    <br>Oulton Broad Parish Council said the metal "boat" was removed because it was blocking a drain and rain was forecast.</h3>
